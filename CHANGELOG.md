### Changed
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Renamed `--http` flag to `--sse` for clarity, distinguishing SSE transport from streamable HTTP transport ([#100](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/100))
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Component registry struct renamed for consistency ([#112](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/112))

- Optimized examples.yml workflow triggers to only run on example changes ([#102](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/102))
- Optimized resource limit parsing with caching using `OnceLock` to avoid repeated string parsing ([#166](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/166))
- Removed policy configuration section from JavaScript/TypeScript WebAssembly Component authoring guide as it's not related to component authoring ([#159](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/159))

### Fixed
