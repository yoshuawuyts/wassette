- Support for Streamable HTTP transport in addition to existing SSE transport ([#100](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/100))

### Fixed

- Fixed permission parsing to support "environment-variable" permission type alias for environment permissions

- Revoke commands and reset permission functionality with simplified storage revocation ([#87](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/87))
- Enhanced `--version` command to display detailed build information with cleaner clap integration ([#119](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/119))
- Parallel component loading for improved performance ([#123](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/123))
- Configuration file management for CLI settings ([#94](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/94))
- LTO (Link Time Optimization) to release builds for 27% size improvement ([#106](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/106))

### Changed
- CLI now supports both server mode (`wassette serve`) and direct management mode for component operations
- Component load/unload operations can now work independently without requiring a running MCP server
- Enhanced help text and command structure with logical grouping of related functionality
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Renamed `--http` flag to `--sse` for clarity, distinguishing SSE transport from streamable HTTP transport ([#100](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/100))
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Component registry struct renamed for consistency ([#112](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/112))
- Pre-instantiated components now used for faster startup time and better performance under load ([#124](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/124))

- Optimized examples.yml workflow triggers to only run on example changes ([#102](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/102))
- Optimized resource limit parsing with caching using `OnceLock` to avoid repeated string parsing ([#166](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/166))
- Removed policy configuration section from JavaScript/TypeScript WebAssembly Component authoring guide as it's not related to component authoring ([#159](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/159))

### Fixed

- Add cargo audit configuration to acknowledge unmaintained `paste` dependency warning ([#169](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/169))

- Installation instructions for Linux and Windows in README ([#120](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/120))

### Technical Details
- Zero code duplication by reusing existing MCP tool handler functions
- CLI-specific wrapper functions (`handle_load_component_cli`, `handle_unload_component_cli`) that work without MCP server peer notifications
- Maintains full backward compatibility with existing `serve` command
- Proper error handling with clear error messages for non-existent components
- Follows common CLI patterns and conventions for intuitive user experience
