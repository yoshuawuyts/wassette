# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Moved the one-liner install script to `scripts/install.sh`; installs now use `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/wassette/main/scripts/install.sh` instead of the previous repository-root path.

### Removed

- Removed the `rules/agent.md` agent-instructions file and the corresponding "Install agent instructions" step from the installation guide.

## [v0.5.0] - 2026-07-22

### Changed

- Updated the changelog agent skill to use focused `changelog.d/` fragments as authoritative wording and category input when maintaining `[Unreleased]`.
- Added portable agent guidance and pull request validation to keep the `[Unreleased]` changelog current for user-facing changes ([#694](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/694)).
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Remote `wassette serve` connections now use Streamable HTTP at `/mcp`; the deprecated SSE transport and `--sse` option were removed, while local `wassette run` integrations continue to use stdio ([#695](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/695)).
- Updated the Rust toolchain requirement to 1.97.1 ([#695](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/695)).
- Renamed example WIT packages and worlds to match their published component names under the `microsoft` namespace, improving compatibility with registry and composition tooling ([#670](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/670)).
- Moved repository tool configuration into `.config/` and the Docker Compose template into `docs/deployment/`, removing unused duplicate root files ([#676](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/676)).

### Fixed

- Release automation now uses explicit workflow handoffs with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, publishes immutable releases only after verifying all assets, supports safe tag-based retries, keeps changelog and package-manifest updates idempotent, and limits prereleases to binary publication.
- Published example OCI images now use semver tags without a leading `v` ([#670](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/670)).
- Repaired the corrupted `Cargo.lock` so workspace builds and dependency resolution work reliably ([#674](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/674)).
- Eliminated intermittent configuration test failures caused by concurrent `WASSETTE_CONFIG_FILE` environment changes ([#675](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/675)).
- Fixed broken installation documentation tabs by adding the required mdBook theme assets ([#672](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/672)).

### Security

- Upgraded RMCP to address the high-severity DNS-rebinding advisory affecting HTTP server transports ([#695](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/695)).

- Automated CHANGELOG synchronization with release pipeline: Release workflow extracts changelog content for release notes and automatically updates CHANGELOG.md post-release. Implemented using Python scripts with unit tests. The update-changelog job now checks that the release job succeeded before running. ([#404](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/404))

- Added `--disable-builtin-tools` flag to the `serve` command that allows disabling all built-in tools (load-component, unload-component, list-components, get-policy, grant/revoke permissions, search-components, reset-permission). When enabled, only loaded component tools will be available through the MCP server ([#374](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette/pull/374))
